# Analyzing Different Statistical for Predicting Advertisment Engagement

## Introduction

Digital advertising relies heavily on data-driven decision-making. This study assesses several statistical methods for predicting ad engagement, including regression models, multivariate analysis, and machine learning algorithms. The research evaluates the accuracy, computational efficiency, and interpretability of ad engagement data by examining real data from various platforms, ad formats, and industries.


## Objective

●	Evaluate the accuracy of logistic regression, PCA, factor analysis, and random forest in predicting ad engagement.

●	Identify the most effective method for predicting ad engagement based on the results.

●	Discuss the limitations and potential applications of each method.

## Result and Discussion

●	The random forest model performs the best in predicting ad engagement, with an accuracy of 0.96.

●	Logistic regression with PCA and only logistic regression have similar accuracy, while factor analysis with logistic regression gives the lowest accuracy.

●	The study highlights the importance of selecting the right statistical technique for a specific dataset and provides insights into the strengths and limitations of each method.
